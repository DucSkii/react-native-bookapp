This app was styles using StyleSheet from react native. This is my first react native project, I was able to transfer my knowledge of react to create the app. This app does not have a lot of functionality and focused on the layout and interactiveness of the app.

To install the code please clone the repository and run "npm install" to get all the dependencies. Run "react-native run-android" to host the application on your android emulator.
